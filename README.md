# Night Duty Scheduler
The Night Duty Scheduling Application optimizes and automates the assignment of night shifts for medical postgraduates. It uses a backtracking algorithm to ensure fair distribution of duties, accounting for blocked dates and minimizing workload gaps. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing schedules and dynamically adjusts shifts to accommodate individual preferences, making the scheduling process more efficient and reducing manual intervention.
This application was inspired by seeing my sister, a medical postgraduate, struggling with her night duty assignments. One afternoon I saw her getting frustrated over her duty being assigned on a family member's birthday despite informing before hand. An idea striked and hence night duty scheduler came into existence. After researching and a few trial and errors, i decided on backtracking algorithm for the schedules and managed to deploy it successfully
# Key Features
#### Backtracking Algorithm: Automatically optimizes night duty assignments, ensuring fair workload distribution and minimal gaps between duties.
Improved Scheduling Efficiency: Outperforms manual scheduling methods by 15-20%, offering better consistency and reduced manual intervention.
Responsive Frontend: Built with React and Tailwind CSS to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Secure Backend: Utilizes Node.js and Express to handle scheduling and doctor data securely.
Database Integration: Uses MongoDB to store doctor schedules and blocked dates for seamless scheduling management.
Deployment: Fully deployed in a production environment with real-time updates.
# Motivation
After observing the difficulties medical postgraduates face when scheduling their duties, I wanted to build a tool that could help streamline the process, reduce errors, and save time. This app aims to provide a more efficient and automated approach to managing night shifts, ensuring a smoother experience for healthcare professionals.
